      <description>I used the Hugo templating framework to build this site, and will list some of the pros/cons that I noticed.
Hugo originally got my attention on HN, through various projects builing landing pages with the framework. Kubernetes also migrated their docs to Hugo recently, citing scaling issues with Jekyll. I was considering using Next.js to make a markdown/jsx-based site, but Hugo was both less complex and more easily scalable than a minimalist node or React website.</description>
