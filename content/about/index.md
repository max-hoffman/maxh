I have shifted between academia, medicine, venture capital and
software engineering since graduating from Pomona College with chemistry
and mathematics degrees. I spent a year working in each field before
taking leave from WashU's MD/PhD program.

I build web services, organize data warehouses, and design machine
learning systems, but my favorite work involves building collaborative
bridges between data science researchers and systems engineers.

AI hype is leaving a glut of unsexy commoditized models in its wake.
Most open source tools are similarly geared towards building and training more
complicated models, despite most companies failing to organize, deploy and monitor
__any__ models in production. I think MLOps tools that work orthogonal to
the iterative training smash-and-grab cycle can help more
industries, data scientists and engineers mazimize their data ROI.

I am also interested in finding ways to modernize academia and healthcare
institutions in ways that better incentivize and promote science,
although I am less optimistic about those things being addressable
without government policy.

I like petting my dogs and reading George Elliot in my free time.
